ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

2
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,918
MISSION:32
WHO IS THIS MISSION FOR?

3
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,883
Both of you, stand back!

4
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,636
<i>I've never seen a weapon like that.</i>

5
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,846
<i>Is it an intermediate-range?</i>

6
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,724
<i>It'll be hard to escape</i>
<i>with the two of them.</i>

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,351
<i>In that case…</i>

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,526
<i>He won't let me get close.</i>

9
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,612
<i>He's very skilled with his weapon.</i>

10
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,115
-What's going on?
-Is it a fight?

11
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,575
-Is he wielding a weapon?
-Someone call State Security.

12
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,701
<i>This is not good!</i>

13
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,080
<i>We're totally attracting attention.</i>

14
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,791
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>At this rate, we'll cause a commotion!</i>

15
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,543
Wow! How amazing!

16
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,923
<i>Anya? Oh crap! I can't have her</i>
<i>see me like this!</i>

17
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:26,386
Wow! You're so cool, Circus Lady!

18
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,268
Oh, this is a performance?

19
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,228
This luxury cruise doesn't disappoint!

20
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,649
<i>What a lifesaver.</i>

21
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,152
<i>It seems like Anya hasn't recognized me.</i>

22
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,611
<i>Let's wrap this up quickly.</i>

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,324
Amazing!

24
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,661
<i>There's a crowd in this hallway,</i>
<i>and nowhere to take shelter.</i>

25
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,663
<i>Olka and her family are behind me.</i>

26
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,499
<i>This is difficult.</i>
<i>I can't get close to him.</i>

27
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,254
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

28
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,007
<i>I'm dragging my feet.</i>

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,510
<i>Why? Am I hesitating to get close to him?</i>

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,890
<i>I know that an injury from that weapon</i>
<i>wouldn't be fatal.</i>

31
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,475
You can do it, Miss!

32
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,895
<i>You have to take him down</i>
<i>before Father comes back.</i>

33
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,688
<i>At this rate,</i>

34
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,900
<i>I should just grab the chain and drag</i>
<i>him down even if I'm to get injured.</i>

35
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,028
<i>But if I don't make it look more</i>
<i>like a performance,</i>

36
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,821
<i>will everyone get suspicious?</i>

37
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,575
<i>What should I do?</i>

38
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,245
-You can do it, old man!
-Show us more flashy moves!

39
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,958
<i>Dammit. I was struggling a bit,</i>
<i>so there's a big crowd now.</i>

40
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,251
<i>They're a hassle.</i>

41
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,255
<i>I'll get rid of all the crowd,</i>
<i>together with my target.</i>

42
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,337
Bravo!

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,422
What an amazing performance!

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,675
Although I didn't understand the story.

45
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,593
<i>Mother is scary.</i>

46
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,846
<i>I think I'll be a little bit more</i>
<i>obedient from now on.</i>

47
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,640
<i>All right! This is perfect.</i>

48
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,850
<i>-She's definitely going to love this!</i>
-Father!

49
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,686
I have to return to the shop!

50
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,690
Where have you been?

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,192
There was a circus performance over there…

52
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,570
<i>Anya has accomplished her task!</i>

53
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,281
<i>I helped Mother</i>

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,200
<i>and completed my mission</i>
<i>without Father finding out!</i>

55
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,078
<i>Heroic Anya!</i>

56
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,207
<i>I can barely calm my heart</i>
<i>from this exciting adventure!</i>

57
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,636
I'll take all of this.

58
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,806
It… it suits you well.

59
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,310
<i>This is flawless.</i>

60
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,229
<i>No matter how you look at it,</i>
<i>I'm a happy, and cheerful dad!</i>

61
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,065
So damn uncool. I'm disappointed.

62
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,071
Let's go.

63
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,576
But man, what kind of crazy fight
did that couple have in that room?

64
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,829
The ice pick was all finagled!
It's so scary!

65
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,416
I'm glad no one was murdered on this ship.

66
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,835
Seriously!

67
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,857
<i>Blueless No. 89</i>
<i>and Mermaid eau de toilette.</i>

68
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,110
<i>This is a different perfume</i>
<i>from the one at the manor.</i>

69
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,322
<i>I guess she changed her perfume</i>
<i>together with her face.</i>

70
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,492
<i>There was at least one man and two women.</i>

71
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,453
<i>Maybe the one I'm not smelling</i>
<i>is the female bodyguard.</i>

72
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,749
It's me. Where are they now?

73
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,126
<i>Don't know.</i>

74
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,631
It's highly likely that they're hiding
in the second or third-class cabins.

75
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,716
But I haven't picked up anything yet.

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,885
<i>I'll post some people around that area.</i>

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,430
<i>Judging by this ship's route,</i>

78
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,643
<i>they'll rendezvous with the other ship</i>
<i>after tomorrow night.</i>

79
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,522
<i>When the time comes, they'll have</i>
<i>no choice but to come out of hiding.</i>

80
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>Keep doing what you do best.</i>

81
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,650
Yeah.

82
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,740
<i>-Did you find them?</i>
<i>-No, not yet.</i>

83
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,284
<i>They told us to head to Deck Three.</i>

84
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,871
What a useless informant.

85
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,791
He better not be planning
to run away with our money.

86
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,504
I won't let him do that.
In fact, I'll take back

87
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,799
everything I paid him, before I disembark.

88
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,761
<i>-What will you do with the money?</i>
<i>-Let's see…</i>

89
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,931
<i>There's never a shortage of idiots.</i>

90
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,143
<i>I should at least make some preparations.</i>

91
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,567
Hey, where are you going?
Our room is this way.

92
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,445
-Mother is in trouble.
-Yor?

93
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,739
I'm sure she's working until late,

94
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,741
but you don't have to worry.

95
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,453
It's time for kids to be in bed. Let's go.

96
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,832
Anya's adventure has barely begun.

97
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,429
<i>She didn't contact us,</i>
<i>so it must mean that she's busy.</i>

98
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,931
We weren't followed, and no bugs.

99
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,934
I think we can rest here for a while.

100
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,481
It seems like the Director
left food here for us as well.

101
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,525
I think we can stay confined
until your ship comes.

102
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,529
It's all right. Stay quiet.

103
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,159
I was so scared!

104
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,121
Who the hell were they?
They were really assassins?

105
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,291
They were shooting
and wielding chains onboard!

106
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,460
You've got to be kidding me!
I want to leave!

107
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,378
Calm down, you dummy.

108
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,049
But did you see those huge men?

109
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,175
They were huge!

110
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,638
You're such a coward.

111
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,932
You're so pathetic,
it makes me want to cry.

112
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,060
You too, little one?

113
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,231
You can't grow up to be like him, okay?

114
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,904
Why did you come with me anyway?

115
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,033
You didn't have to get yourself involved
in all this danger.

116
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,911
You should've stayed
with the new organization.

117
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,248
It's because…

118
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,415
of you…

119
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,334
-What?
-Well…

120
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,005
Please don't underestimate me.

121
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,217
I'm not so hopeless that I would
forget all that Boss did for me.

122
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,388
<i>After the war, when there was no food,</i>

123
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,516
<i>I would've died of hunger</i>
<i>if it wasn't for your family's</i>

124
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,518
<i>black market.</i>

125
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,520
Here, take this.

126
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,031
It's our secret.

127
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,704
Hey Olka. Where are you?

128
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,167
<i>I still remember the taste of that bread.</i>

129
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,548
That's more than enough reason
for me to be here.

130
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,259
Zeb.

131
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,346
Plus, did you know

132
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,016
Hapoon is currying favors with warmongers

133
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,394
in order to make money
in the arms industry? He's a bastard.

134
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,938
You can count on me!

135
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,026
Even if Hapoon's minions come after us,
I'll beat them up like crazy!

136
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,696
Sorry, that was a lie!

137
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,199
Welcome.

138
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:35,082
In the last room, you forgot about our
secret knock and tried to open the door.

139
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,251
I'm sorry. I'll be more careful!

140
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,880
The three of you should rest
in preparation for tomorrow.

141
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,050
I'll be placing Forger at the door.

142
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,135
How can we sleep in this situation?

143
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,141
-What about you, Director?
-I'll be patrolling this floor

144
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,145
and if possible, I'll reduce
the number of enemies.

145
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,606
You guys are really amazing.

146
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,984
You guys are so calm even when your
life's on the line. How can you do that?

147
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,487
This is our job.

148
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,740
So "kill or get killed,"
is a normal thing?

149
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,283
I have no words.

150
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,494
It's been over ten years
since the war ended,

151
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,664
but I guess there are still wars going on
all over the place.

152
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,838
As long as humans exist,
there will be no end to fighting.

153
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,133
Whether we're at war or at peace,

154
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,387
we're just soldiers for our country.

155
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,642
If need be, I will send you a signal
with my footsteps.

156
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,936
Don't let your guard down.

157
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,145
Yes, I understand.

158
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,649
-Forger?
-Yes?

159
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,153
Focus on your mission.
Or everyone will die.

160
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,415
How scary!
That's what you call a pro, huh?

161
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,627
Just as the Director said,
all of you should rest.

162
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,963
Or just lie down.

163
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,715
You have to gain strength for tomorrow.

164
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,885
Please keep your shoes on
in case of emergency.

165
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,304
I understand.

166
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,307
I'll turn off the lights.

167
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,048
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

168
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,219
<i>I never got the chance to contact</i>
<i>Loid and Anya.</i>

169
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,847
<i>My situation wouldn't allow that, but…</i>

170
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,316
<i>Maybe I was dragging my feet</i>

171
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,820
<i>because I was afraid of getting hurt.</i>

172
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,242
<i>If I get wounded so badly that I have</i>
<i>no excuse to tell Loid and Anya,</i>

173
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,329
<i>I wouldn't be able to live</i>
<i>with them anymore.</i>

174
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,082
Your family is just for your cover, right?

175
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,880
<i>That's right, Yor.</i>

176
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,466
<i>You must set your priorities straight.</i>

177
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,472
<i>For what…</i>

178
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,727
<i>For what am I…?</i>

179
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,899
APPROXIMATELY 20 HOURS
UNTIL THE RENDEZVOUS

180
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,283
Why am I looking after this dog
so early in the morning?

181
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,161
Don't you bark at me, dammit!

182
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,581
I'm not a pet-sitter or a babysitter!

183
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm busy with my underground things!
Give me back my time!

184
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,920
Oh my, what a cute dog!

185
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,879
What?

186
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,425
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

187
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,846
This is my first time I've seen you here.
Do you live around here?

188
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,306
Oh… ah… kind of…

189
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,852
I hope we bump into each other again!

190
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,149
Do you want to be my dog?

191
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,614
<i>My name is Twilight.</i>

192
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,117
<i>I'm the number one spy in Westalis.</i>

193
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,744
<i>No matter what the situation,</i>

194
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,581
<i>even if I'm placed in the jaws of death,</i>

195
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,584
<i>I'm trained to remain calm.</i>

196
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,045
<i>The power of observation, discernment,</i>
<i>and adaptability.</i>

197
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,798
<i>I honed such skills to the limit,</i>

198
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,217
<i>and that's how I survived this world</i>
<i>until today.</i>

199
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,012
<i>-But…</i>
-Go away!

200
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,763
So damn uncool.

201
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,768
<i>I had become big-headed.</i>

202
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,230
<i>There are still many things</i>
<i>in this world that I don't know.</i>

203
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,776
<i>I shouldn't let my knowledge</i>
<i>and experience make me overconfident.</i>

204
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,029
<i>The root of all human's fear is</i>
<i>the "unknown."</i>

205
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,658
<i>Death, invisible evil spirits, neighboring</i>
<i>countries, and next door neighbors.</i>

206
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,745
<i>Their "unknown identities"</i>
<i>is what provokes fear.</i>

207
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,789
<i>Some brush it aside as something</i>
<i>"unable to understand,"</i>

208
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,001
<i>and turn a blind eye. Others would</i>

209
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,296
<i>label it as what they see fit,</i>
<i>and put their hearts at ease.</i>

210
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,509
<i>I… I am a spy.</i>

211
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,470
<i>I do not fear the unknown.</i>

212
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:43,474
<i>No, I will face the fear rationally,</i>
<i>and I will deal with it.</i>

213
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,686
<i>Just like how scientists lit up</i>
<i>the darkness…</i>

214
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,481
<i>and how they discovered</i>
<i>new viruses and vaccines…</i>

215
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,609
<i>Second day of the cruise.</i>

216
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,862
<i>I will overcome this difficult situation!</i>

217
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,083
-What?
-We're done entertaining the guests?

218
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,127
It seems like they had a big fight
last night.

219
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,130
Mrs. Grey got very angry about

220
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,548
Mr. Grey soiling his pants.

221
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,176
<i>So they're not in the mood</i>
<i>for any entertainment.</i>

222
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,261
<i>I… I see.</i>

223
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,223
<i>-What about the business invitation…</i>
<i>-Back to square one.</i>

224
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,185
Don't worry.
You guys didn't do anything wrong.

225
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,020
I'll look after the couple.

226
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,148
You two can enjoy yourselves today.

227
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,734
-I understand.
<i>-Hooray!</i>

228
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,740
<i>Time for an adventure. Time for exploring</i>

229
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,786
<i>Another day of heroic Anya's trip!</i>

230
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,247
<i>-Observe. Discern. Adapt.</i>
<i>-Exciting adventure</i>

231
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,750
<i>-What's the meaning behind these lyrics?</i>
<i>-Exciting time exploring</i>

232
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,003
<i>I fell asleep last night,</i>

233
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,756
<i>but I have to hurry up and find Mother</i>
<i>so that I can help her. But…</i>

234
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,050
Father, Mother's in trouble

235
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,261
so we have to go help her now!

236
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,013
What do you mean?

237
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,641
No way! Yor battles with people?

238
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,227
How can this be? Oh my god!

239
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,187
<i>That's what'll happen,</i>
<i>so I can't tell him!</i>

240
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,191
<i>I have to do something</i>
<i>and ditch Father somewhere.</i>

241
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,195
Look Father! It's a place to play golf!

242
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,741
-You want to try it?
<i>-For some reason, adults love to golf.</i>

243
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,748
<i>While Father is engrossed with golfing,</i>

244
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,332
<i>I'm going to slip away.</i>

245
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,422
A hole-in-one for every hole?

246
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,426
-Bravo!
<i>-Oh no! He finished already!</i>

247
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,470
Here. Give it a try.

248
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,429
It's fun.

249
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,643
Argh!

250
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,438
Calm down, and aim well.

251
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,154
It's almost time for lunch.

252
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,697
I won't leave until it goes in!

253
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,326
<i>A successful experience is important.</i>

254
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,828
<i>I'll let her continue</i>
<i>until she's satisfied.</i>

255
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,497
<i>Discern and adapt.</i>

256
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,292
-Don't get too loud and disturb others.
-Argh!

257
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,841
<i>I fell for Father's trap</i>
<i>and wasted my time!</i>

258
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,427
<i>I need to think of a new plan!</i>

259
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,595
Chew well.

260
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,181
<i>Father loves to take in knowledge.</i>

261
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,100
<i>I'm sure he'll lose</i>
<i>his sense of time here!</i>

262
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,438
<i>These are all books I've read before.</i>

263
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,525
COMIC

264
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,443
<i>But I'm glad she's having fun.</i>

265
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,861
Oh, I forgot!

266
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,241
Puzzles are so much fun.

267
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,203
It looks really difficult,
so I think I'll need your help, Father.

268
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,581
<i>I can probably finish this in two minutes.</i>

269
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,999
<i>Let's see.</i>

270
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,339
<i>Observe.</i>

271
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,926
-Wow!
<i>-Observe.</i>

272
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,476
<i>I haven't been able to ditch Father,</i>
<i>and it's already dinner!</i>

273
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,938
<i>Not only that, I was having so much fun,</i>
<i>I forgot about Mother!</i>

274
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,106
<i>Argh!</i>

275
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,025
<i>Why? Why is she scowling at me?</i>

276
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,027
<i>It seemed like she was having so much fun!</i>

277
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,780
<i>Why does she look so upset right now?</i>

278
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,491
<i>Did I make some sort of a mistake?</i>

279
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,952
<i>Calm down, Twilight. Face the unknown.</i>

280
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,329
<i>Does she hate me?</i>
<i>Is this the rebellious phase?</i>

281
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,457
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>the Forger family will fall apart.</i>

282
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,795
Does your stomach hurt? Are you okay?

283
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,299
<i>I’m troubling Father.</i>

284
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,469
I'm okay. I'm enjoying this adventure.

285
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,014
Is that so? Then I'm glad.

286
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,602
But I'm a little lonely
that Mother isn't with us.

287
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,981
I want to be with both Father and Mother.

288
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,109
<i>That's why I have to go</i>
<i>by myself to help Mother.</i>

289
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,069
I see.

290
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,237
<i>She's right.</i>

291
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,656
It would've been nice
if Yor had time off work.

292
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,493
<i>She's still a young child.</i>

293
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,289
It won't hurt to ask Yor
if she's open tomorrow.

294
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,458
You know where Mother is?

295
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,212
No, but I'll have the concierge
deliver her a message for me.

296
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,924
-Once she replies, we can meet up.
-Okay!

297
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,677
By the way, there's going to be
a fireworks show on the deck tonight.

298
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,389
It's tonight's main event,

299
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,351
so Yor and her group might be there too.

300
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,479
It might be hard to find her
among the crowd, but want to go?

301
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,648
Fireworks! Yes, I want to go!

302
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,251
Yes.

303
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,794
Yes.

304
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,089
It was the Director.

305
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,551
He received a message from the ship
waiting for you guys, and they're ready.

306
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,179
We'll be meeting them in four hours,

307
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,098
but we need to make preparations.

308
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:20,811
More importantly, this deck
is surrounded by enemies,

309
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,938
so we'll leave this room
and head somewhere else.

310
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,983
<i>Please get changed.</i>
<i>We have wigs prepared too.</i>

311
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,943
<i>Okay. Got it.</i>

312
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,738
It's me. Any movement?

313
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,117
I intercepted an unidentified
encrypted communication.

314
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,036
It's not the frequency used
by the State Security.

315
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,747
<i>-Is it a message for those people?</i>
-It's a possibility.

316
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,500
Okay. Notifying everyone.

317
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,962
Get into your stage three positions
and lie in wait for them.

318
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,429
All right. All clear.

319
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,472
Let's go.

320
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,908
MISSION:33
